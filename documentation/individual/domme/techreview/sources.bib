abstract = "{Sea turtle stranding events provide an opportunity to study drivers of mortality, but causes of strandings are poorly understood. A general sea turtle carcass oceanographic drift model was developed to estimate likely mortality locations from coastal sea turtle stranding records. Key model advancements include realistic direct wind forcing on carcasses, temperature driven carcass decomposition and the development of mortality location predictions for individual strandings. We applied this model to 2009–2014 stranding events within the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia. Predicted origin of vessel strike strandings were compared to commercial vessel data, and potential hazardous turtle-vessel interactions were identified in the southeastern Bay and James River. Commercial fishing activity of gear types with known sea turtle interactions were compared to predicted mortality locations for stranded turtles with suggested fisheries-induced mortality. Probable mortality locations for these strandings varied seasonally, with two distinct areas in the southwest and southeast portions of the lower Bay. Spatial overlap was noted between potential mortality locations and gillnet, seine, pot, and pound net fisheries, providing important information for focusing future research on mitigating conflict between sea turtles and human activities. Our ability to quantitatively assess spatial and temporal overlap between sea turtle mortality and human uses of the habitat were hindered by the low resolution of human use datasets, especially those for recreational vessel and commercial fishing gear distributions. This study highlights the importance of addressing these data gaps and provides a meaningful conservation tool that can be applied to stranding data of sea turtles and other marine megafauna worldwide. •Development of a general turtle carcass oceanographic drift model•Improvement in our ability to predict sea turtle mortality from stranding data•Identified potential locations of hazardous turtle-human interactions in Virginia•Quantitative assessments hindered by the low resolutions of human use datasets}",

abstract = "{1 Pacific leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea populations have been declining precipitously. It has been suggested that fishery‐associated mortality is the leading factor causing the decline; however, the sensitivity of leatherbacks to climate variability relative to their population ecology is unknown. 2 We investigated the effects of interannual climate variability, as governed by the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), on leatherback nesting ecology. We used equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly data over various time scales derived from both moored buoys and remote satellites as signals of ENSO. We then incorporated these data into a remigration probability model for the largest nesting population of eastern Pacific leatherbacks at Parque Nacional Marino Las Baulas (PNMB), Costa Rica. 3 Our results showed that nesting females of PNMB exhibited a strong sensitivity to ENSO, as reflected in their nesting remigration probabilities. Cool La Ni{\~{n}}a events corresponded with a higher remigration probability and warm El Ni{\~{n}}o events corresponded with a lower remigration probability. 4 We suggest that productivity transitions at leatherback foraging areas in the eastern equatorial and south‐eastern Pacific in response to El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a events result in variable remigration intervals and thus variable annual egg production. This phenomenon may render the eastern Pacific leatherback population more vulnerable to anthropogenic mortality than other populations. 5 Synthesis and applications. Physical indices of environmental variation can be used to estimate the probability of leatherbacks remigrating to nest at PNMB. This type of modelling approach can be extremely useful for understanding the effects of climatic variation on the population dynamics of sea turtles. Our remigration probability model can be applied to any monitored sea turtle nesting population where nesting site fidelity and beach monitoring coverage remains high. This modelling approach can help nesting beach monitoring programmes forecast remigrant numbers based on prior climate data, and can further quantify anthropogenic mortality by validating survival estimates.}",

@article{NeemanNoga2014Mmot,
abstract = "{The purpose of this dissertation was to study how sea turtles currently respond to changes in temperature, in order to predict how they may respond to climate change in the future. I looked at two of the most commonly reported responses to changes in temperature: phenology shifts and changes in the duration of remigration intervals. I studied how the timing of leatherback nesting at three nesting beaches responds to temperature changes at both the nesting and the foraging grounds. There was no effect for local temperatures, but there was an overall trend for delayed nesting with increased temperatures at the foraging grounds. Deviations from this trend as well as different trends found in other studies suggest that the phenological response is complex and variable. To look at remigration intervals, I developed a theoretical, physiologically-based model that links temperature to resource availability and its accumulation by sea turtles, remigration intervals, and nesting numbers. The model shows that apparent nesting cohorts are formed not by life history traits but rather by a population-level response to environmental temperatures and that these cohorts are unstable over time. Using the model to explore different temperature history scenarios showed that short pulses of altered temperatures can have a large effect on nesting numbers. Cold pulses tend to synchronize nesting in the following year, owing to decreased remigration intervals, while warm pulses tend to delay nesting in a less synchronized way. Cyclical temperature variation increases remigration intervals in general and leads to a cyclical response in both remigration intervals and nesting numbers, with a lag and amplitude that vary with cycle duration. Adapting this model to specific populations of leatherback turtles reveals that it is able to capture both year-to-year and decade-to-decade trends in remigration intervals for both populations. Due to the difficulties in isolating the effect of strong population trends on nesting numbers and oscillations, it is unable to predict nesting numbers. Future model iterations should include inherent population trends to allow for better comparison and forecasting as well as using the model to help plan conservation efforts and properly interpret changes in nesting numbers.}",
