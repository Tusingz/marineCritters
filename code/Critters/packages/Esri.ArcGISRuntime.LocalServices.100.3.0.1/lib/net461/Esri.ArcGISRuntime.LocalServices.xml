            <remarks>
            <para>
            Before using the the LocalServer the runtime deployment must be licensed with a valid license string. For more information please see the
            <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.ArcGISRuntimeEnvironment">ArcGISRuntimeEnvironment class</see>. Once the license string has been set and the ArcGISRuntime initialized,
            the recommended approach to start the LocalServer is by calling the asynchronous InitializeAsync method and listening for the
            InitializeCompleted event or by using the overloaded <see cref="M:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalServer.StartAsync">
            Initialize(Action) method</see> and passing in an action callback delegate.
            </para>
            <para>
            To determine the current state of the LocalServer the Status property will provide a <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalServerStatus">
            LocalServerStatus</see> value or alternatively the property IsRunning can be used to quickly determine whether the
            LocalServer is currently running.
            </para>
            <para>
            Finally, when the LocalServer is no longer required the asynchronous <see cref="M:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalServer.StopAsync">
            ShutdownAsyncTask method</see> should be called to shutdown the LocalServer and recover any resources being used. Once the LocalServer
            has shutdown it will trigger the ShutdownCompleted event, or alternatively you can use the overloaded
            <see cref="M:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalServer.StopAsync">ShutdownAsyncTask() method</see> to provide
            an action callback delegate.
            </para>
            <para>
            It is not necessary to work with the LocalServer directly. Instead, creating and starting the individual LocalService classes (
            <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalMapService">LocalMapService</see>, <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalFeatureService">

            <para>
            The folder specified by this property will contain data created by the runtime deployment which should be persisted between application sessions.
            The runtime deployment will write all application-related data to the folder specified by this property for the lifetime of the application.
            The property must be set each time your application starts but before the <see cref="M:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalServerEnvironment.Initialize"/> method is called.

            You should therefore consider how much space may be required by this folder when setting the property.
            Packages will be unpacked to "{AppDataPath}\Documents\ArcGIS\Packages".
            Other data written to the folder specified by this property can be considered internal to the runtime deployment and typically does not require significant disk space.

            <para>
            If not specified, <see cref="P:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.ArcGISRuntimeEnvironment.TempPath"/> will be used. It is therefore recommended that this

            <para>
            This property, in conjunction with the <see cref="P:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.ArcGISRuntimeEnvironment.TempPath"/> property enable you to have control over any application-related or temporary data

            <remarks>
              <para>
            When creating LocalGeoprocessingServices to run Geoprocessing tools and models you must choose whether that service will run synchronously (<see cref="F:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.GeoprocessingServiceType.SynchronousExecute"/>),
            asynchronously (<see cref="F:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.GeoprocessingServiceType.AsynchronousSubmit"/>) or asynchronously with an dedicated LocalMapService instance to draw the result (<see cref="F:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.GeoprocessingServiceType.AsynchronousSubmitWithMapServiceResult"/>).
            The synchronous Execute option should be chosen if the tool will take less than 15 seconds to complete but for larger and more complex tools which take longer than 15 seconds it is recommended
            that the asynchronous SubmitJob option is used. The synchronous Execute option will result in a single RuntimeLocalServer.exe worker process being created to perform the work
            (in addition to the primary RuntimeLocalServer process) whereas the
            asynchronous SubmitJob option will result in two RuntimeLocalServer.exe processes, one to undertake the actual processing and one to monitor the processing. Lastly, the asynchronous option with a
            map server result produces three RuntimeLocalServer.exe processes where the third one is a LocalMapService instance employed to render the results of the Geoprocessing operation.
            Once the LocalGeoprocessingService has started the setting becomes read-only for the lifetime of that service and cannot be changed once the service is running.

            <remarks>
            <para>A single local geoprocessing service instance corresponds directly to a geoprocessing package shared from ArcGIS for Desktop.
            One or more geoprocessing tasks may be exposed by the local geoprocessing service depending on the number of individual tool or script results
            contained within the geoprocessing package. When starting local geoprocessing services there are a number of properties you must choose values for
            which are usually determined by the server administrator for online geoprocessing services hosted by ArcGIS for Server.
            </para>
            <para>
            These properties are:
            <list type="buller">
            <item>
            Service execution type: The <see cref="P:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalGeoprocessingService.ServiceType"/> property determines whether the service will run the task asynchronously or
            synchronously. This affects how the client application you are developing interacts with the runtime local server and gets the result from the task.
            When a service is set to <see cref="F:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.GeoprocessingServiceType.SynchronousExecute"/> (synchronous) operation, the client waits for the task to finish. Typically, a service that
            will run tasks synchronously should execute quickly (five seconds or less). A service should be set to use the <see cref="F:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.GeoprocessingServiceType.AsynchronousSubmit"/>
            (asynchronous) if one or more of that tasks within that service will takes longer to run. When using the SubmitJob mode the client application
            must periodically ask the server if the task has finished and, if it has finished, get the result.
            The GeoprocessingServiceType enumeration values which determine the synchronous or asynchronous service operation are called "Execute" and "SubmitJob" to align
            them with the corresponding methods on the Geoprocessor task API and to differentiate them from the synchronous or asynchronous usage.
            You must use the method which corresponds to the GeoprocessingServiceType of the local geoprocessing service you are working with.
            The service mode <see cref="F:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.GeoprocessingServiceType.AsynchronousSubmitWithMapServiceResult"/> will enable you to display the results of the task within a local map service.
            </item>
            <item>
            Maximum number of records returned: The maximum number of results the service can return to a client.
            Setting this value to a large number means your runtime local server can handle sending a lot of individual records or features to the client
            application. Whether you choose this pattern depends on the number and complexity of the feature geometries. If you do not want to return any features, set this value to 0 (zero). Typically, you set this value to zero only when you create the
            service as <see cref="F:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.GeoprocessingServiceType.AsynchronousSubmitWithMapServiceResult"/>. To determine whether the <see cref="P:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalGeoprocessingService.MaxRecords"/> limits has been exceeded you should
            check the exceeded transfer limit property of the feature set or record set returned by the task. The exceeded transfer limit property will be set to true
            when the number of records and features of the output parameter exceed the maximum number of records specified by the service. this information is also included
            in the <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Tasks.JobMessage"> Messages</see> of <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Tasks.Geoprocessing.GeoprocessingJob"/> returned by the service.

            The LocalMapService class represents a map service hosted by the LocalServer.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            A local map service provides access to maps, features, and attribute data contained within a Map Package. Local map services are typically
            used to display operational or business data on top of a tiled basemap layer.
            Map images from local map services are dynamically rendered from the data with each request (e.g. when the user pans the map). Local map services
            do not support caching in the same way as other server-based map services. To use local cached maps in your application you should use the
            <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Mapping.ArcGISTiledLayer">ArcGISLocalTiledLayer class</see>.
            Local map services have built-in capabilities that allow each layer's behavior and appearance to be changed dynamically.
            These dynamic layers can increase the amount of interaction that users are able to have with maps within your application. For more information see
            the <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Mapping.ArcGISMapImageLayer">ArcGISDynamicMapServiceLayer class</see> documentation.
            </para>
            <para>
            Local map services don't always need to display images. You can create a local map service for the purpose of returning a set of features to work within your
            application. You retrieve these features through tasks that you add to your application. For example, you might want to query a map service and display
            the resulting features as graphics in the map. Local map services always have their Query and Data operations enabled in contrast to map services hosted
            by ArcGIS for Server where these operations can be explicitly enabled or disabled by the server administrator.
            </para>
            <para>
            To start a LocalMapService you can either create a new instance of a LocalMapService object via the default constructor then
            set the path property or use the <see cref="M:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalMapService.#ctor(System.String)">overloaded constructor</see>.
            Once the path property has been set by either approach above, the <see cref="M:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalMapService.StartAsync">
            StartAsyncTask</see> method should be called to start the LocalMapService which will be hosted by the
            <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalServer"/>. The <see cref="P:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalService.Status">Status</see> property
            can be checked to determine the <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalServerStatus">LocalServiceStatus</see> state.
            </para>
            <para>
            Alternatively the <see cref="M:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalService.StartAsync">overloaded StartAsyncTask</see>
            method can be called.
            </para>
            <para>
            Finally, there is one other convenience method for obtaining a LocalMapService object.
            Based on the supplied path to a Map Package the GetServiceAsyncTask method will either start a new LocalMapService or return a reference to an existing
            LocalMapService if one has previously been created for that particular Map Package resource with the same service properties.

            The StartAsyncTask method will perform various checks to ascertain the status of both the LocalMapService instance
            and the underlying LocalServer:
            <list type="bullet">

            First the <see cref="T:Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices.LocalServerStatus"/> of the
            LocalMapService instance will be ascertained. In the cases that it is already LocalServerStatus.Started or
            LocalServerStatus.Starting the method will exit.
            If the LocalMapService creation failed, the current status will be LocalServerStatus.Failed,
            and an InvalidOperationException will be thrown.
            </item>
            <item>
            The status of the LocalServer will then be confirmed. If the status is LocalServerStatus.Initialized the
            LocalMapService creation will continue. In the cases that the LocalServer is LocalServerStatus.NotInitialized or
            LocalServerStatus.Initializing an attempt will be made to start the LocalServer and execution will wait until
            the status is LocalServerStatus.Initialized at which point the attempt to create the LocalMapService will be remade.
            The status will also be LocalServerStatus.Failed if the StartAsyncTask method is called whilst the LocalServer
            is shutting down. If the underlying LocalServer encountered an error and failed to initialize correctly
            an exception will be raised.

            The MaxRecords property should be set before the LocalMapService has started.
            This property has a default value of 1000. If the property is not set explicitly the service will return the first 1000 records.
            The service can still exceed the MaxRecords property set.
            For both these scenarios more information can be found in the results of an operation to find out whether the service has exceeded the MaxRecords property set.
            To improve performance it is recommended that the MaxRecords property is set in order to limit an operation that may return a large number of results.
