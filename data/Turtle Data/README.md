This folder contains the final product of merging and cleaning up all of the stranded 
sea turtle data.  Only California stranding events need to have lat and longs added. 
Duplicates and entries missing information have been removed.  
The Clean_BMC_DB_ORTurt.csv file is the file that is deployed with our project.  It only
contains stranding events on the Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Canadian coasts. The other
clean .csv file contains California entries.
The .csv file that has "reordering" the title allows fields to be sorted.  The folder 
"Original Files" contains all of the raw data and files used to process to get to the finished
product.
