This folder contains the source data collected for stranded sea turtles
in the raw format that it was received.  The excel files for standardizing and merging into one
file are also here.  The data were in differing formats with different amounts of information.
BMC_database.csv and .xlsx both contain the complete data.  Included in this folder is a real
stranding report and a picture of a sea turtle that was found on a beach.
The "DataComplete" folder contains both the completed compilation files and the raw data files 
that were being merged.
